## 📡 n8n Workflow Overview

* **Webhook Trigger** – Accepts topic input from frontend
* **AI Agent Node** – Generates 3 recipe responses
* **Function Node** – Parses and formats to JSON
* **Supabase Node** – Stores recipe entries
* **Response Node** – Sends structured JSON back to the frontend

---
