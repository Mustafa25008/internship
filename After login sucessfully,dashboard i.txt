After login sucessfully,dashboard is openning and there is button "+Add Recipe" which is not working. I want that when we clicked on this button it will open a form or page with these text entries, one for entering "Recipe Title/Name", second to enter "Recipe with details/ingredients", one text entry to enter time because when i clicked on "Generate AI Recipe" button it showing a recipe that also show time it take to ready, with clock icon. After entering complete these details and when we clicked on add button on this form/page this recipe added on the dashboard with the recipe generated by AI but instead of this "AI Generated" which is showing on right side of recipe title/name,it show this "Added Recipe"
